# AWS IoT Specialist Training - Session 2 (Advanced Topics for IoT)

The content in this repo will be used for the AWS IoT Specialist Training session scheduled for January 26th and 27th, 2022.

This is part two of a learning series which will build on previous training where we provided a high level overview of ML/DL and how they could be used by customer including training models and deploying them.  This session will build on that idea and dive deeper into how customer can use ML/DL concepts and services to build out entire pipelines with accelerated models.
Training material created as part of this session includes:
 - Introduction to Jetson Nano hardware and software stacks
 - Model Optimization with NVIDIA TensorRT
 - Building Video Analytics pipelines with NVIDIA DeepStream
 - Incorporating DeepStream with AWS Greengrass v2 and IoT Core to deploy edge services with cloud support
